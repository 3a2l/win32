# The Windows Security app

The Windows Security app (WSC) is a comprehensive reporting tool that helps users establish and maintain a protective security layer around their computer systems. Once a security layer is established, the Windows Security app is inconspicuous as it monitors the computer’s health state. However, if vulnerabilities exist, WSC provides alerts and prescriptive guidance to assist the user in achieving a secure state which is surfaced to the end user through the Action Center.

In order for third party security solutions (antivirus, antimalware, or antispyware) to be compliant with Windows and successfully report status to Action Center, they are required to register themselves with Defender for Cloud and report any subsequent status changes using private APIs for communicating with WSC. WSC, in turn, communicates these updates to Action Center, where they are finally displayed to the end user.
